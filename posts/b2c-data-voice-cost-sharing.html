        <p class="post__item-text">Sharing a plan can be more cost-effective than each member having their individual portion of voice or data package, as
        it often includes discounts due to social buying of higher traffic volumes.</p>

    <div class="post__item">
        <h6 class="post__item-title">Convenience:</h6>
        <p class="post__item-text">It's convenient for people who frequently communicate with each other, as calls or text messaging within the same
        carrier's network is discounted.</p>
